# Titanic-Passenger-Survival-Prediction
In this project, I worked with the Titanic Passenger Database using python libraries to predict passenger survival. I carried out data cleaning on both testing and training data and created data visualizations to compare survival rate based on different attributes such as age, sex, socioeconomic background, number of family members etc. By applying machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Model, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Models, the program was able to predict passenger survival on the test set. 

Libraries used: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
